Theoretical Interludes, Design Notes and ToDo (long term with no deadline)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[This is a major research oriented extension of iCloud(AsFer+USBmd+VIRGO) and COBRA project (done by the author in his BE (1995-1999) along with few other esteemed classmates. http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/Excerpts_Of_PSG_BE_FinalProject_COBRA_done_in_1999.pdf/download.)]

1. There is a cloud of nodes which execute a set of services from randomly created clients. 

2. This cloud could be on iCloud (AsFer+USBmd+VIRGO) platform or any other opensource cloud platforms like Hadoop Cluster.

3. The Clients are publishers of Service requests which are of many types -  miscellaneous types of Service that could be dynamically added through other kernel modules and invoked through a switch-case or embedded in function itself. Identified by unique id(s) for different types of services (for example Problem reports, Suggestions etc.,)

4. The Services on the Cloud are Subscribers to these requests of specific type. Thus this is the conventional publisher-subscriber model.

5. The requests flow through cloud using a workqueue (which could be a lowlevel Linux workqueue or VIRGO queue or some other queuing middleware software like ActiveMQ). The publishers enqueue and Subscribers dequeue the requests.

6. The difference is that the Cloud has nodes that "deceive" or "corrupt". 

7. Service requests - are published by the clients in the need of a service which could be defined by markup file. These requests are scheduled and routed by the middleware to competent authority which services it (with or without timeframe) and replies to the client.

8. Problem reports - are published by clients which are "dissatisfied" by the quality of service by the cloud. These are analyzed by "arbiters" in the cloud which find the faulting node(s) and take action. This allows manual intervention but minimizes it.

9. Suggestions - are enhancement requests sent by clients and require manual intervention.

10. Cloud nodes have a Quality of Service metric calculated by a model.

11. The cloud has a reporting structure of nodes - either as a graph or tree. The graph is dynamically reorganized by weighting the Quality of Service of each node.

12. The difficult part of the above is using Arbiters to find "faulty" nodes based on problem reports from clients.  

13. Brewer's CAP conjecture proved by [GilbertLynch] as a theorem (still debated) states that only 2 of the 3 (Consistency of data, Avaliability of data and Partition tolerance when some nodes or messages are lost) can be guaranteed and not all 3 are simultaneously achievable. 

14. CAP theorem does not seem to apply to the above faulty scenario with corrupt nodes under Consistency or Availablity or Partition Tolerance. This is because a corrupt node can have any 2 of the 3 - it can give consistent data, is available with success response or can make the cloud work with missing data in partition tolerance but yet can "corrupt" the cloud. Probably this needs to be defined as a new attribute called Integrity.

15. As "corruption" is more conspicuous with monetary element, if above services are "charged" with a logical currency (e.g. bitcoin), then corruption in cloud is defineable approximately as (but not limited to)- "Undue favour or harm meted out to a client not commensurate with the charge for the service (or) unreasonable extra logical currency demanded to execute the service of same quality (or) deliberate obstruction of justice to a client with malevolent and unholy collusion with other cloud nodes with feigned CAP". 

16. Identifying criminal nodes as in (15) above seems to be beyond the ambit of CAP. Thus CAP with Integrity further places a theoretical limit on "pure" cloud. If Integrity is viewed as a Byzantine problem with faulty or corrupt processes in a distributed system, and if resilience factor is rf (expected number of faulty nodes), then most algorithms can ensure a "working" cloud only if resilience is ~30% or less (3*rf+1) of the total number of cloud nodes. Probably this could apply to Integrity also that places a limit of 30% on "corrupt nodes" for the Cloud to work with sanity.

17. Analytics on the Problem reports sent to the cloud queue give a pattern of corrupt nodes. Intrinsic Merit ranking with Citation graph maxflow considering cloud as a flow network where a node positively or negatively cites or "opines" about a node, as mentioned in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 (author's Master's thesis) and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf(published by the author during PhD) give a p2p ranking of cloud nodes that can be used for analysis though may not be reliable fully. 

18. Policing the cloud nodes with arbiters - This seems to be limited by CAP theorem and Integrity as above. 

19. Brooks-Iyengar algorithm for sensors in all cloud nodes is an improved Byazantine Fault Tolerant algorithm.

20. BitCoin is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol.

21. Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Clouds is described in http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/cloud/2011/4460/00/4460a444-abs.html, http://www.eurecom.fr/~vukolic/ByzantineEmpire.pdf which is more on Cloud of Clouds - Intercloud with cloud nodes that have malicious or corrupt software. Most of the key-value(get/set) implementations do not have byzantine nodes (for example CAP without Byzantine nodes in Amazon Dynamo: http://www.eurecom.fr/~michiard/teaching/slides/clouds/cap-dynamo.pdf)

22. The problem of fact finding or fault finding using a cloud police has the same limitation as the "perfect inference" described in http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/AstroInferDesign.txt

24. KingCobra messaging request-response design - options
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

24a. Implementing a message subscription model in kernelspace where clients publish the message that is queued-in to subscribers' queue (Topic like implementation - use of ActiveMQ C implementation if available).

24b. (ONGOING) At present a minimum kernelspace messaging system that queues remote request and handles through workqueue handler is in place. This does not respond to the client once the Kingcobra servicerequest function finishes processing the request. Unlike the usual messaging server, in which client publishes messages of a particular type that are listened to by interested clients, one option is to continue the status-quo of KingCobra as a peer-to-peer messaging system. Thus every VIRGO node is both a kernelspace messaging client and server that can both publish and listen. Every message in the cloud can have a unique id assigned by a timestamp server (similar to bitcoin protocol) so that each message floating in the cloud is unique across the cloud (or) no two messages on the VIRGO cloud are same. The recipient node executing kingcobra_servicerequest_kernelspace() parses the unique-id (example naive unique-id is <ip-address:port>#localtimestampofmachine) from the incoming remote request and responds to the remote client through kernel socket connection  that gets queued-in the remote client and handled similar to incoming remote request. To differentiate request and response-for-request response messages are padded with a string "REPLY:<unique-id-of-message>" and requests are padded with "REQUEST:<unique-id-of-message>". This is more or less similar to TCP flow-control with SEQ numbers but state-less like UDP. Simple analogy is post-office protocol with reference numbers for each mail and its reply. Thus there are chronologically two queues: (1) queue at the remote VIRGO cloud service node for request (2) queue at the remote client for response to the request sent in (1).

24c. KingCobra - VIRGO queue - VIRGO cpupooling and mempooling drivers interaction schematic diagram:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	KingCobraClient ==========>=<REQUEST:id>===================> VIRGO cpupooling service =====> VIRGO Queue ============> KingCobraService
               ||								       					         ||
	       ||				 				   	 					 ||	
		<================= VIRGO Queue <====== VIRGO cpupooling service ====<REPLY:id>=================================== V
	
	KingCobraClient ==========>=<REQUEST:id>===================> VIRGO mempooling service =====> VIRGO Queue ============> KingCobraService
               ||								       					         ||
	       ||				 				   	 					 ||	
		<================= VIRGO Queue <====== VIRGO mempooling service ====<REPLY:id>==================================== V


kingcobra_servicerequest_kernelspace() distinguishes the "REQUEST" and "REPLY" and optionally persists them to corresponding on-disk filesystem.
Thus a disk persistence for the queued messages can either be implemented in 1) VIRGO queue driver 2)  workqueue.c (kernel itself needs a rewrite (or) 3) KingCobra driver. Option (2) is difficult in the sense that it could impact the kernel as-a-whole whereas 1) and 3) are modularized.

24d.Above option 24b implements a simple p2p queue messaging in kernel. To get a Topic-like behaviour in VIRGO queue might be difficult as queue_work() kernel function has to be repeatedly invoked for the same work_struct on multiple queues which are subscribers of that message in AMQ protocol. Moreover creating a queue at runtime on need basis looks difficult in kernel which is usually done through some CLI or GUI interface in ActiveMQ and other messaging servers. 

25. For the timestamp service, EventNet described in http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/AstroInferDesign.txt is a likely implementation choice.

-----------------------------------------------
Commits as on 1 March 2014
-----------------------------------------------
Example java Publisher and Listeners that use ActiveMQ as the messaging middleware have been committed to repository for an ActiveMQ queue instance created for KingCobra. For multiple clients this might have to be a Topic rather than Queue instance. Request types above and a workflow framework can be added on this. This will be a JMS compliant implementation which might slow down compared to a linux workqueue or queue implementation being done in VIRGO.
----------------------------------------------
Commits as on 17 March 2014
---------------------------------------------
KingCobra userspace library and kernelspace driver module have been implemented that are invoked 1) either in usermode by call_usermodehelper()
2) or through intermodule invocation through exported symbols in KingCobra kernel module, by the workqueue handler in VIRGO workqueue implementation.

---------------------------------------------
Commits as on 22 March 2014
---------------------------------------------
Minimalistic Kernelspace messaging server framework with kernel workqueue,handler and remote cloud client has been completed - For this VIRGO clone cpupooling driver has been added a clause based on a boolean flag, to direct incoming request from remote client to VIRGO linux workqueue which is popped by workqueue handler that invokes a servicerequest function on the KingCobra kernel module. (Build notes: To remove any build or symbol errors, Module.symvers from VIRGO queue has to be copied to VIRGO cloudexec and built to get a unified VIRGO cloudexec Module.symvers that has exported symbol definitions for push_request()). End-to-end test with telnet path client sending a request to VIRGO cloudexec service, that gets queued in kernel workqueue, handled by workqueue handler that finally invokes KingCobra service request function has been done and the kern.log has been added to repository at drivers/virgo/queuing/test_logs/

----------------------------------------------
Commits as on 29 March 2014
----------------------------------------------
Initial commits for KingCobra Request Response done by adding 2 new functions parse_ip_address() and reply_to_publisher() in kingcobra_servicerequest_kernelspace()

--------------------------------------------
Commits as on 30 March 2014
--------------------------------------------
Both VIRGO cpupooling and mempooling drivers have been modified with use_as_kingcobra_service boolean flag for sending incoming remote cloud node requests to VIRGO queue which is serviced by workqueue handler and KingCobra service as per the above schematic diagram and replied to.

--------------------------------------------
Commits as on 6 April 2014
--------------------------------------------
Fixes for REQUEST and REPLY headers for KingCobra has been made in virgo_cloudexec_mempool recvfrom() if clause and in request parser in KingCobra with strsep(). This has been implemented only in VIRGO mempool codepath and not in VIRGO clone.

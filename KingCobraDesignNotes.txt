Theoretical Interludes, Design Notes and ToDo (long term with no deadline)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[This is a major research oriented extension of iCloud(AsFer+USBmd+VIRGO) and COBRA project (done by the author in his BE (1995-1999) along with few other esteemed classmates. http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/Excerpts_Of_PSG_BE_FinalProject_COBRA_done_in_1999.pdf/download.)]

[KingCobra though a misnomer is expanded as ClOud With ARBiters MimicKING containing the anagram] 

1. (THEORY) There is a cloud of nodes which execute a set of services from randomly created clients. 

2. (THEORY) This cloud could be on iCloud (AsFer+USBmd+VIRGO) platform or any other opensource cloud platforms like Hadoop Cluster.

3. (THEORY) The Clients are publishers of Service requests which are of many types -  miscellaneous types of Service that could be dynamically added through other kernel modules and invoked through a switch-case or embedded in function itself. Identified by unique id(s) for different types of services (for example Problem reports, Suggestions etc.,)

4. (THEORY) The Services on the Cloud are Subscribers to these requests of specific type. Thus this is the conventional publisher-subscriber model.

5. (THEORY) The requests flow through cloud using a workqueue (which could be a lowlevel Linux workqueue or VIRGO queue or some other queuing middleware software like ActiveMQ). The publishers enqueue and Subscribers dequeue the requests.

6. (THEORY) The difference is that the Cloud has nodes that "deceive" or "corrupt". 

7. (THEORY) Service requests - are published by the clients in the need of a service which could be defined by markup file. These requests are scheduled and routed by the middleware to competent authority which services it (with or without timeframe) and replies to the client.

8. (THEORY) Problem reports - are published by clients which are "dissatisfied" by the quality of service by the cloud. These are analyzed by "arbiters" in the cloud which find the faulting node(s) and take action. This allows manual intervention but minimizes it.

9. (THEORY) Suggestions - are enhancement requests sent by clients and require manual intervention.

10. (THEORY) Cloud nodes have a Quality of Service metric calculated by a model.

11. (THEORY) The cloud has a reporting structure of nodes - either as a graph or tree. The graph is dynamically reorganized by weighting the Quality of Service of each node.

12. (THEORY) The difficult part of the above is using Arbiters to find "faulty" nodes based on problem reports from clients.  

13. (THEORY) Brewer's CAP conjecture proved by [GilbertLynch] as a theorem (still debated) states that only 2 of the 3 (Consistency of data, Avaliability of data and Partition tolerance when some nodes or messages are lost) can be guaranteed and not all 3 are simultaneously achievable. 

14. (THEORY) CAP theorem does not seem to apply to the above faulty scenario with corrupt nodes under Consistency or Availablity or Partition Tolerance. This is because a corrupt node can have any 2 of the 3 - it can give consistent data, is available with success response or can make the cloud work with missing data in partition tolerance but yet can "corrupt" the cloud. Probably this needs to be defined as a new attribute called Integrity.

15. (THEORY) As "corruption" is more conspicuous with monetary element, if above services are "charged" with a logical currency (e.g. bitcoin), then corruption in cloud is defineable approximately as (but not limited to)- "Undue favour or harm meted out to a client not commensurate with the charge for the service (or) unreasonable extra logical currency demanded to execute the service of same quality (or) deliberate obstruction of justice to a client with malevolent and unholy collusion with other cloud nodes with feigned CAP". 

16. (THEORY) Identifying criminal nodes as in (15) above seems to be beyond the ambit of CAP. Thus CAP with Integrity further places a theoretical limit on "pure" cloud. If Integrity is viewed as a Byzantine problem with faulty or corrupt processes in a distributed system, and if resilience factor is rf (expected number of faulty nodes), then most algorithms can ensure a "working" cloud only if resilience is ~30% or less (3*rf+1) of the total number of cloud nodes. Probably this could apply to Integrity also that places a limit of 30% on "corrupt nodes" for the Cloud to work with sanity. Translating this to a Governance problem, a corruption-free administration is achievable with a maximum limit of 30% "corrupt" elements. 

17. (THEORY) Analytics on the Problem reports sent to the cloud queue give a pattern of corrupt nodes. Intrinsic Merit ranking with Citation graph maxflow considering cloud as a flow network where a node positively or negatively cites or "opines" about a node, as mentioned in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 (author's Master's thesis) and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf(published by the author during PhD) give a p2p ranking of cloud nodes that can be used for analysis though may not be reliable fully. 

18. (THEORY) Policing the cloud nodes with arbiters - This seems to be limited by CAP theorem and Integrity as above. Also this is reducible to perfect inference problem in http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/AstroInferDesign.txt and drafts in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/

19. (THEORY) Brooks-Iyengar algorithm for sensors in all cloud nodes is an improved Byazantine Fault Tolerant algorithm.

20. (THEORY) BitCoin is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol.

21. (THEORY) Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Clouds is described in http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/cloud/2011/4460/00/4460a444-abs.html, http://www.eurecom.fr/~vukolic/ByzantineEmpire.pdf which is more on Cloud of Clouds - Intercloud with cloud nodes that have malicious or corrupt software. Most of the key-value(get/set) implementations do not have byzantine nodes (for example CAP without Byzantine nodes in Amazon Dynamo: http://www.eurecom.fr/~michiard/teaching/slides/clouds/cap-dynamo.pdf)

22. (THEORY) Related to point 18 - The problem of fact finding or fault finding using a cloud police has the same limitation as the "perfect inference" described in http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/AstroInferDesign.txt. "Money trail" involving the suspect node in point 28 is important to conclude something about the corruption. In real world tracking money trail is a daunting task. In cloud that abides by CAP, missing messages on trail can prevent reaching a conclusion thereby creating benefit-of-doubt. Also fixing exact value for a transaction that involves MAC currency message is undecidable - a normative economics problem can never be solved by exact theoretical computer science.

24. KingCobra messaging request-response design - options
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

24a. Implementing a message subscription model in kernelspace where clients publish the message that is queued-in to subscribers' queue (Topic like implementation - use of ActiveMQ C implementation if available).

24b. (DONE-minimal implementation) At present a minimum kernelspace messaging system that queues remote request and handles through workqueue handler is in place. This responds to the client once the Kingcobra servicerequest function finishes processing the request(reply_to_publisher() in KingCobra driver). Unlike the usual messaging server, in which client publishes messages of a particular type that are listened to by interested clients, one option is to continue the status-quo of KingCobra as a peer-to-peer messaging system. Thus every VIRGO node is both a kernelspace messaging client and server that can both publish and listen. Every message in the cloud can have a unique id assigned by a timestamp server (similar to bitcoin protocol) so that each message floating in the cloud is unique across the cloud (or) no two messages on the VIRGO cloud are same. The recipient node executing kingcobra_servicerequest_kernelspace() parses the unique-id (example naive unique-id is <ip-address:port>#localtimestampofmachine) from the incoming remote request and responds to the remote client through kernel socket connection  that gets queued-in the remote client and handled similar to incoming remote request. To differentiate request and response-for-request response messages are padded with a string "REPLY:<unique-id-of-message>" and requests are padded with "REQUEST:<unique-id-of-message>". This is more or less similar to TCP flow-control with SEQ numbers but state-less like UDP. Simple analogy is post-office protocol with reference numbers for each mail and its reply. Thus there are chronologically two queues: (1) queue at the remote VIRGO cloud service node for request (2) queue at the remote client for response to the request sent in (1). Thus any cloudnode can have two types of messages - REQUEST and REPLY. Following schematic diagram has been implemented so far.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24c.(DONE) KingCobra - VIRGO queue - VIRGO cpupooling , mempooling and queue service drivers interaction schematic diagram:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	KingCobraClient ==========>=<REQUEST:id>===================> VIRGO cpupooling service =====> VIRGO Queue ============> KingCobraService
               ||								       					         ||
	       ||				 				   	 					 ||	
		<================= VIRGO Queue <====== VIRGO cpupooling service ====<REPLY:id>=================================== V
	
	KingCobraClient ==========>=<REQUEST:id>===================> VIRGO mempooling service =====> VIRGO Queue ============> KingCobraService
               ||								       					         ||
	       ||				 				   	 					 ||	
		<================= VIRGO Queue <====== VIRGO mempooling service ====<REPLY:id>==================================== V
	
	KingCobraClient ==========>=<REQUEST:id>===================> VIRGO Queue service ====================================> KingCobraService
               ||								       					         ||
	       ||				 				   	 					 ||	
		<================= VIRGO Queue service ============================<REPLY:id>==================================== V



24d. (ONGOING) kingcobra_servicerequest_kernelspace() distinguishes the "REQUEST" and "REPLY" and optionally persists them to corresponding on-disk filesystem.  Thus a disk persistence for the queued messages can either be implemented in 1) VIRGO queue driver 2)  workqueue.c (kernel itself needs a rewrite (or) 3) KingCobra driver. Option (2) is difficult in the sense that it could impact the kernel as-a-whole whereas 1) and 3) are modularized. At present Option 3 persistence within KingCobra driver has been implemented.

24e.Above option 24b implements a simple p2p queue messaging in kernel. To get a Topic-like behaviour in VIRGO queue might be difficult as queue_work() kernel function has to be repeatedly invoked for the same work_struct on multiple queues which are subscribers of that message in AMQ protocol. Moreover creating a queue at runtime on need basis looks difficult in kernel which is usually done through some CLI or GUI interface in ActiveMQ and other messaging servers. 

25. For the timestamp service, EventNet described in http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/AstroInferDesign.txt is a likely implementation choice.

26. (THEORY) MESSAGE-AS-CURRENCY PROTOCOL: If each message payload is also construed as a currency carrier, each message id can be mapped to a unique currency or a coin with fixed denomination. This is similar to each currency note having a serial number as unique id. Uniqueness is guaranteed since there can be only one message (or coin) with that id on the cloud. This simulates a scenaio - "Sender of the message pays the Receiver with a coin having the unique id and Receiver acknowledges receipt". This is an alternative to BitCoin protocol. Double spending is also prohibited since at any point in time the message or "coin" with unique id can be sent by only one node in the cloud. Unique Cloudwide Timestamp server mimicks the functionality of "Mint". There is a difference here between conventional send-receive of messages - Once a message is sent to remote cloud node, no copy of it should exist anywhere in the cloud. That is, every MAC currency message is a cloudwide singleton. In pseudocode this is expressible as:
	m1=MAC_alloc(denomination)
	m2=m1 (---- this is disallowed)
Linux kernel allocation functions - kmalloc() - have a krefs functionality for reference counting within kernel. Refcount for MAC message can never exceed 1  across cloud for above singleton functionality - this has to be a clause everywhere for any unique MAC id. This requires a cloudwide krefs rather. Buyer decrements cloudwide kref and Seller increments it.

27. (THEORY) SIMULATING A VIRTUAL ECONOMY with above MAC protocol (Message-as-currency): If each message sent is considered as "money" element and cloud nodes and clients are the consumers and producers of "electronic money", the timestamp "Mint" becomes a virtual Federal Reserve or Central Bank that controls the "electronic money" circulation in the cloud. Infact any REPLY messages could be mapped to a Service a client derives by s(p)ending the REQUEST "money message". Thus value(REQUEST) should equal value(REPLY) where value() is a function that measures the value of a money denomination and the value of goods and/or services for that money. For example Rs.10000 or $10000 has no meaning if it doesn't translate into a value (analogy: erstwhile Gold Standard).When the value() function gets skewed phenomena like Inflation arise. Thus above model could also have a notion of value() and "electronic money inflation". Thus any "message money" with a unique id assigned by the cloud unique id(or logical timestamp) server can exist at most in only one node in the cloud. Money trail can be implemented by prefixing a header to the incoming message money in each cloud node that receives the money which traces the "path" taken. Cloud has to implement some Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol. The value() function to some extent can measure the "deceit" as above. When a Buyer and Seller's value() functions are at loggerheads then that is starting point of "cloud corruption" at either side and might be an undecidable problem. 

28. (THEORY) TRADING WITH ABOVE KINGCOBRA MAC protocol - somewhat oversimplified:
				
				--------------------
				|Unique MAC id MINT|
				--------------------
					||
	-----money trail------------------
	|
	V
	....
	Buyer	======= sends MAC message (REQUEST id) =======> Seller (stores the MAC in local cash reserve and prepends money trail)
	||							||
	<============ sends the goods and services (REPLY id) ===

In the above schematic, money with unique id in cloud reaches a buyer after many buyer-seller transitions called "money trail". The MAC currency is prefixed by each node to create a chain. Buyer then sends a request to the seller through MAC virtual currency and seller replies with goods and services. Seller prepends the money trail chain. When a transaction occurs the whole cloud need not be notified about it except only buyer and seller. MAC Mint could create a bulk of money denominations and circulate them in cloud economy.

29. (THEORY) VALUE FOR ELECTRONIC MONEY: How is above MAC money earned - This again requires linking value to money (as money is not a value by itself and only a pointer to valuable item or resource). Thus any buyer can "earn" MAC money by something similar to a barter.

30. (THEORY) FIXING VALUE FOR MAC MONEY: To delineate corruption as discussed in 27 above with value() disparity between MAC money and REPLY goods and services, an arbiter node in cloud has to "judge" the value of MAC sent by buyer and goods and services from seller and proclaim if corruption exists. Thus value() function itself has to be some kind of machine learning algorithm. This is related to or same as points 12 to 23 above. For example, while buying an item for few million bucks, value() has to take as input the description of the item and calculate the value "ideally" which is difficult. Because there are no perfect references to evaluate and only a weighted average of available market price range has to be taken as a reference which is error-prone. value() function can be recursively defined as("Reductionism"):
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|value(i) = summation(value(ingredients of i)) + cost(integrating the ingredients to create item i) |
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously the above recursion combinatorially explodes into exponential number of nodes in the recursion tree. Ideally recursion has to go deep upto quarks and leptons that makeup the standard model. If for practical purposes, recursion depth is restricted to t then size of value() tree is O(m^t) where m is average number of ingredients per component. Hence any algorithm computing the value() recursion has to be exponential in time. Computation of value() in the leaf nodes of the recursion is most crucial as they percolate bottom-up. If leaf nodes of all possible items are same (like quarks and leptons making up universe) then such atomic ingredient has to have "same" value for all items. Only the integration cost varies in the levels of the tree.For infinite case, value() function is conjectured to be undecidable - probably invoking some halting problem reduction .But above value() function could be Fixed Parameter Tractable in parameter recursion depth - t but yet could only be an approximation. A Turing machine computing value() function exactly might loop forever and thus Recursively Enumerable and not Recursive.

31. (THEORY) Buyer-Seller and MAC electronic money transaction schematic:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Buyer     	 A-------<id><refcnt:0>----------------------> Seller <id><refcnt:1> (increments refcnt)
	(<id><refcnt:1>  |
	 <id><refcnt:0>  |
	after decrement  |
	refcnt           |
	)---------------->
Above has to be transactional (i.e atomic across cloud nodes)

32. (THEORY) MAC protocol reaper
--------------------------------
Reaper thread in each cloud node harvests the zero refcounted allocations and invokes destructors on them. Same  MAC id cannot have kref count of 1 or above in more than one cloud node due to the transaction mentioned previously.

33. (THEORY) Cloud Policing With Arbiters - Revisited:
------------------------------------------------------
When a suspect node is analyzed when a complaint problem is filed on it, (1) it is of foremost importance on how flawless is the arbiter who investigates on that and is there a perfect way to choose a perfect arbiter. In the absence of the previous credibility of entire cloud judiciary is blown to smithereens and falls apart. (2) Assuming a perfect arbiter which is questionable, next thing is to analyze the credibility of the node who sulked. This is nothing but the Citation problem in http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102 and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf where a node can positively or negatively cite another node which is "Societal Norm" which can be faulted and citations/opinions could be concocted with malafide intent(perjury). This is rather a generalization of PageRank algorithm with negative citations. Thus Perfect Cloud Arbitration could be an unsolvable problem. (3) Even if both arbiter and complainant are perfect which is again questionable, there are still loopholes - lack of evidences or implicated witnesses might portray a negative impression of a positive node. Thus there are 3 tiers of weakenings in cloud arbitration and there could be more. P(Good) series in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ precisely addresses this problem.

34. (THEORY) MAC Money Flow as MaxFlow problem:
-------------------------------------------
Transactions happening in a cloud are edges between the nodes involved (buyer and seller). Thus it creates a huge directed graph. Flow of money in this graph can be modelled as Flow network. Minimum Cut of this graph shows crucial nodes in the graph which play vital role in cloud economy removal of which paralyzes the cloud (could be Central bank and other financial institutions).

35. (THEORY) Cycles and components in above MAC Money Flow Graph:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Above graph of money transactions could be cyclic which implies a supply chain. Strongly connected components of this graph are most related nodes that are in same industry. 

36. (THEORY) STOCK TRADING:
---------------------------
One of the component in above MAC Money Flow Graph of cloud could be a virtual Stock Exchange. Based on the transactions in the graph, index of the exchange varies. 

-----------------------------------------------
Commits as on 1 March 2014
-----------------------------------------------
Example java Publisher and Listeners that use ActiveMQ as the messaging middleware have been committed to repository for an ActiveMQ queue instance created for KingCobra. For multiple clients this might have to be a Topic rather than Queue instance. Request types above and a workflow framework can be added on this. This will be a JMS compliant implementation which might slow down compared to a linux workqueue or queue implementation being done in VIRGO.
----------------------------------------------
Commits as on 17 March 2014
---------------------------------------------
KingCobra userspace library and kernelspace driver module have been implemented that are invoked 1) either in usermode by call_usermodehelper()
2) or through intermodule invocation through exported symbols in KingCobra kernel module, by the workqueue handler in VIRGO workqueue implementation.

---------------------------------------------
Commits as on 22 March 2014
---------------------------------------------
Minimalistic Kernelspace messaging server framework with kernel workqueue,handler and remote cloud client has been completed - For this VIRGO clone cpupooling driver has been added a clause based on a boolean flag, to direct incoming request from remote client to VIRGO linux workqueue which is popped by workqueue handler that invokes a servicerequest function on the KingCobra kernel module. (Build notes: To remove any build or symbol errors, Module.symvers from VIRGO queue has to be copied to VIRGO cloudexec and built to get a unified VIRGO cloudexec Module.symvers that has exported symbol definitions for push_request()). End-to-end test with telnet path client sending a request to VIRGO cloudexec service, that gets queued in kernel workqueue, handled by workqueue handler that finally invokes KingCobra service request function has been done and the kern.log has been added to repository at drivers/virgo/queuing/test_logs/

----------------------------------------------
Commits as on 29 March 2014
----------------------------------------------
Initial commits for KingCobra Request Response done by adding 2 new functions parse_ip_address() and reply_to_publisher() in kingcobra_servicerequest_kernelspace()

--------------------------------------------
Commits as on 30 March 2014
--------------------------------------------
Both VIRGO cpupooling and mempooling drivers have been modified with use_as_kingcobra_service boolean flag for sending incoming remote cloud node requests to VIRGO queue which is serviced by workqueue handler and KingCobra service as per the above schematic diagram and replied to.

--------------------------------------------
Commits as on 6 April 2014
--------------------------------------------
Fixes for REQUEST and REPLY headers for KingCobra has been made in virgo_cloudexec_mempool recvfrom() if clause and in request parser in KingCobra with strsep(). This has been implemented only in VIRGO mempool codepath and not in VIRGO clone.

-------------------------------------------
Commits as on 7 April 2014
-------------------------------------------
New function parse_timestamp() has been added to retrieve the timestamp set by the VIRGO mempool driver before pushing the request to VIRGO queue driver

------------------------------------------
Commits as on 29 April 2014
------------------------------------------
Intial commits for disk persistence of KingCobra request-reply queue messages have been done with addition of new boolean flag kingcobra_disk_persistence. VFS calls are used to open and write to the queue.

------------------------------------------
Commits as on 26 August 2014
------------------------------------------
KingCobra driver has been ported to 3.15.5 kernel and bugs related to a kernel_recvmsg() crash, timestamp  parsing etc., have been fixed. The random crashes were most likely due to incorrect parameters to filp_open() of disk persistence file and filesystem being mounted as read-only.
